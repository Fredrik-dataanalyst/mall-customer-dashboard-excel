## Dataset

The data used in this project is the **Mall Customer Segmentation Data** available on Kaggle. This dataset includes customer demographic information, annual income, and spending scores (A metric of the customers' spending power), which are used to analyze customer segments. The demographic information is the customers' age and sex. 

## Motivation

One could ask what type of customer the Mall's marketing team should target with their campaigns to obtain more profit. The demographic of the mall's customers is important in itself for this matter, whether the customers are males or females, or the age of the customers. For the larger group of customers visiting the mall, the mall should emphasise targetting, making this group spend more. Another idea is to target customers with higher annual income and higher spending scores, making more customers in this category visit the mall and buy products.
